## MVC, MVP, MVVM
- Model-view-controller(MVC)
- ![the MVC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wsqstar/geos-img/main/Screenshot%202022-11-22%20at%2014.35.14.png)
- Android
  - [life-cycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)
  - Manifest

### KEY PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
Class Variable Method
![the most important one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wsqstar/geos-img/main/Screenshot%202022-11-22%20at%2014.47.04.png)

  - Inflate the MapView
  - Create an ArcGISMap
  - Set the map to the MapView
