python is quite improtant.

# Loop
- When using while, don't forget to get use index and index +1 to exit loop.

# Dictionary
- dictionary is good but while introduce refresh problem when you add new data.So if you encounter this problem, you might need dynamitic naming method.
  - ward_name might a good key but what if they got same name? :)

# Reading data
- the readline() is quite useful when you want to sepcify one line and you can use seek(0) to go back to the very beggining ofthe line.
- readlines() can read the entrie file but will encounter different shape problem.
- Question: how about readline in the output of readlines()?
## list
- when reading the x and y data, we can make is in the shape of xyxyxyxyxy, which means one list and x in even position and y in add position
  - we can also make them in the shape of xxxx yyyy, which means two lists


# data processing
- T.replace('A','B') will replace A in T with B, and it's ok if T don't have A.
- the normal read data way:
  - read line
  - process the data
  - append into array or list
- and we can use number: current_line to record the cuttent processed line to help get better result of line
