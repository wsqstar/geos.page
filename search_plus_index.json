A combination of videos and excercies and takes around 4 hours to complete. Covers: Basics, List, Packages, Functions and NumPy. Also covers introductions to R and SQL which could be useful. Link: https://www.datacamp.com CodeAcademy Fundamental programming concepts and the Python programming language course. Lessons are interactive. Time to complete is estimated at 25 Hours and there are no prerequisites. The syllabus is extensive and covers: Python Syntax, Strings and Console Output, Conditionals and Control Flow, Functions, Lists & Dictionaries, Lists and Functions, Loops, Advanced Topics in Python, Introduction to Classes, File Input and Output.Link: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python Quantum GIS https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/trainingmaterial/index.htmlThis freeware GIS is now well developed, and there are a good set of related resources, including tutorials at sites such as the one below. You can download the actual GIS software, and practice with the data sets provided. These resources cover basic GIS principles, all the way up to advanced topics including using python programming with GIS, conducting network analysis and more advanced spatial analysis, plus introductory web mapping.http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/ESRI Virtual Campus https://www.esri.com/training/This commercial site provides training resources for using ArcGIS and its extensions.

Dictionary dictionary is good but while introduce refresh problem when you add new data.So if you encounter this problem, you might need dynamitic naming method. ward_name might a good key but what if they got same name? :) 3. Reading data the readline() is quite useful when you want to sepcify one line and you can use seek(0) to go back to the very beggining ofthe line. readlines() can read the entrie file but will encounter different shape problem. Question: how about readline in the output of readlines()?3.1. list when reading the x and y data, we can make is in the shape of xyxyxyxyxy, which means one list and x in even position and y in add position we can also make them in the shape of xxxx yyyy, which means two lists 4. data processing T.replace('A','B') will replace A in T with B, and it's ok if T don't have A. the normal read data way: read line process the data append into array or list and we can use number: current_line to record the cuttent processed line to help get better result of line see this Use Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)            updated 2023-01-17 15:52:25 "}}
