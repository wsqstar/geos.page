Time to complete is estimated at 25 Hours and there are no prerequisites. The syllabus is extensive and covers: Python Syntax, Strings and Console Output, Conditionals and Control Flow, Functions, Lists & Dictionaries, Lists and Functions, Loops, Advanced Topics in Python, Introduction to Classes, File Input and Output.Link: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python Quantum GIS https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/trainingmaterial/index.htmlThis freeware GIS is now well developed, and there are a good set of related resources, including tutorials at sites such as the one below. You can download the actual GIS software, and practice with the data sets provided. These resources cover basic GIS principles, all the way up to advanced topics including using python programming with GIS, conducting network analysis and more advanced spatial analysis, plus introductory web mapping.http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/ESRI Virtual Campus https://www.esri.com/training/This commercial site provides training resources for using ArcGIS and its extensions.
